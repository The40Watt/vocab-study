    <h1>Roadmap for features</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>New function to export words from a users library into a .cvs file.</li>
        <li>Add margin to top of alerts to move away from the header.</li>
        <li>Need to create an FAQ page - create new heading in the nav bar. </li>

        <li>Ability for user to create their own categories?</li>
        <li>Feature to track number of badges earned per user? If a user earns a badge, add a row to a new table like tb_badge_records. One row per badge for a user, can then count this table to see how many badges a user has. Get a star / symbol for completing all badges.</li>

        <li>A function to count the number of words per user and compare to others. The user with the most words gets a star / symbol beside their name / on homepage.</li>
        <li>A default value for each user for the language they are learning.</li>
        <li>Drop-down for number of words to test is hard-coded, not codes table driven.</li>
        <li>Admin - see total number of users, total words etc... on main page.</li>
