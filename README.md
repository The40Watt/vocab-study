# WORD UP
**Build your vocabulary one word at a time.

## Description
The idea behind the website is to help language learners build out their vocabulary in their target language. The website is designed to be a clean and bloat free experience.  The functionality is simple, add new words to your vocabulary library and then test your recall of those words. The test feature will always pick the words that have been tested the least. There is other functionality there to edit existing words or delete them from your library. When adding new words, you must choose what category they will be stored under.

## Development
The website is fully functional now, at least in my local development environment. It has been developed using _XAMPP_ with a _MYSQL_ database and _PHP_. There is some _JavaScript_ in there too.

## Deployment
At this point the website only exists in my own development environment. The goal is to purchase a domain, most likely a _.ie_ domain and to find a web hosting service for the site.

## Features Roadmap
I have several new features planned once the website is active.

+ Ability to export word library to .csv
+ Function to change up test so that you can choose to translate from target language or native language
+ Change to allow the user to add / edit their own word categories
